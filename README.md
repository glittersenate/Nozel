## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Icon import errors**: Check [`DEPENDENCIES.md`](./DEPENDENCIES.md) for correct Lucide React icon names
2. **Build failures**: Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` fresh
3. **TypeScript errors**: Ensure all components follow the type definitions

### Fresh Installation

For the cleanest setup without lockfile dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

This ensures you get the latest compatible versions of all dependencies.
